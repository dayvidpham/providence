# Provenance global journal — relational contract

Status: normative. This document is the relational contract and proof corpus
specification for the global-journal architecture amendment tracked by
`dayvidpham/provenance#4`, `#5`, and `#6`. It supersedes the `TaskEvent`-only
schema described in the historical bodies
of those issues and in `dayvidpham/provenance#7`'s corpus harness for any
detail that conflicts with what follows. Existing implementation attempts on
prior `provenance-4--*`/`provenance-5--*`/`provenance-7--*` branches are
salvage input, not canonical schema; concrete regressions they exposed are
cited by name throughout as motivation for specific design choices, and are
carried forward as named adversarial histories in the proof corpus (see
[Adversarial proof corpus](#adversarial-proof-corpus)).

This document does not implement anything. It defines every relation, its
attributes and typed-ID domains, its functional dependencies and candidate
keys, its chosen primary/foreign keys, and — where a naive design would
violate BCNF — the decomposition that resolves it. Implementation
(`dayvidpham/provenance#4`'s journal base, `#5`'s operations/authority, `#6`'s
DBOS adapter) consumes this document; it does not restate or reinterpret its
own schema.

## 1. Architectural principle

Provenance owns exactly one global, append-only, database-generated,
integer-ordered journal. Every persisted fact about task/domain history,
committed operations, authority lifecycle, decisions, and material-work
evidence is a row in this journal or in a typed subtype table keyed by the
journal row it extends. There is no second ordering domain, no second
validation reducer, and no redundant closure list stored beside the journal.

Three doctrines govern every relation below:

1. **`JournalID` is the sole canonical order.** It is a database-generated
   `INTEGER` surrogate key. Every authorization check, replay, lifecycle, and
   convergence decision orders by `JournalID`, never by `RecordedAt`. Display
   listings may additionally be ordered by `RecordedAt` as a non-causal readable
   timeline (doctrine 2, §12.1), but no causal decision ever consults that order.
2. **`RecordedAt` is display/audit metadata — a readable timeline, never
   causality.** Its purpose is to present a readable timeline over what happened
   (§12.1), and the query surface exposes an `OrderByRecordedAt` display order for
   exactly that. It never establishes causality, authorization, lifecycle order,
   or migration replay order. Two journal rows may share an identical `RecordedAt`
   (clock granularity, concurrent commits, or honestly-replayed legacy
   timestamps); `JournalID` still totally orders them, and the timeline order
   breaks the tie by `JournalID`.
3. **Common fields live on the supertype exactly once.** No subtype table
   repeats `JournalKind`, `ActorID`, or `RecordedAt`.

Typed-ID domains used throughout (Go-level types; SQL storage type in
parentheses): `TaskID`/`ActorID`/`ActivityID`/`CommentID` (`TEXT`,
`namespace--uuidv7`, unchanged from the existing schema — `AgentID` remains a
deprecated source alias for `ActorID`, identical wire format), `JournalID`
(`INTEGER`), `OperationID` (`TEXT`, caller-supplied), `OperationAuthorityID`
(`TEXT`, opaque), `AssignmentID` (`TEXT`, opaque), `EventKind` /
`ContextKind` / `DecisionKind` / `EvidenceKind` (`TEXT`, namespaced
`provenance.foo.bar` / `pasture.foo.bar` strings, open/extensible, validated
but not FK-enforced against a closed lookup table), `CommandDigest` /
`MutationDigest` / `ContentDigest` (`BLOB`, opaque digests), `GitOID`
(`TEXT`, 40- or 64-char lower-case hex).

A relation-naming convention is used to keep the discriminator visible: every
table that is a typed subtype of the journal is named `journal_<family>`, and
its primary key is always `JournalID`, a foreign key into `journal`. This is
class-table inheritance: one row in `journal`, at most one matching row in
exactly one subtype table selected by `JournalKind`.

**Attribute naming (logical vs physical).** This contract names attributes by
their **Go-level type names in PascalCase** — `JournalID`, `ActorID`, `TaskID`,
`RecordedAt`, `ProducedByOperationJournalID` — for every relation. The **physical
SQL columns** use the repository's `snake_case` convention uniformly:
`journal_id`, `actor_id`, `task_id`, `recorded_at`,
`produced_by_operation_journal_id`, `kind_id`. The mapping is mechanical
(PascalCase attribute ↔ its `snake_case` column); in particular the journal
supertype's primary-key column is `journal_id`, consistent with its siblings
`kind_id` / `actor_id` / `recorded_at`. Illustrative DDL and SQL in this document
uses the logical PascalCase names for readability; the executable schema and every
query string use the `snake_case` columns.

## 2. Journal supertype

### 2.1 `journal`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | `INTEGER` | no | database-generated (`AUTOINCREMENT`), PK |
| `JournalKind` | FK → `journal_kinds.id` | no | discriminator: `operation` \| `task_event` \| `authority` \| `decision` \| `evidence` |
| `ActorID` | FK → `agents.id` (ActorID domain) | yes | the actor whose committed operation produced this row; present **only** on an anchor row (`ProducedByOperationJournalID IS NULL` — an operation anchor, genesis, or migration baseline). A subordinate (operation-produced) row carries `ActorID` NULL and derives its actor from its anchor via the [§8.5](#85-journal_attributed-view-not-a-base-relation) self-join. `ActorID NOT NULL` **iff** `ProducedByOperationJournalID IS NULL`, enforced by a `CHECK` constraint and [§10 rule 5](#10-totality-rules) |
| `RecordedAt` | `INTEGER` (UnixNano, UTC) | no | audit/display metadata only — see [§7](#7-recordedat-doctrine) |
| `ProducedByOperationJournalID` | FK → `journal_operations.JournalID` | yes | the operation that produced this row; NULL **only** on the row that is itself the operation anchor (`JournalKind = 'operation'`) — see [§5](#5-totality-rules); **S1.1 staging note:** at the journal-base layer this column is uniformly NULL on `task_event` rows too (no `journal_operations` anchor exists yet to reference), so at that layer every `task_event` row is an anchor and legitimately carries `ActorID` — see the staging note after [§10 rule 2](#10-totality-rules) |

**Functional dependencies:** `{JournalID} → {JournalKind, ActorID, RecordedAt, ProducedByOperationJournalID}`. `ActorID` is stored on **anchor rows only** (those with `ProducedByOperationJournalID IS NULL`); a subordinate row's `ActorID` column is NULL, and its effective actor is *derived*, not stored — it equals its anchor's `ActorID`, reachable by the self-join `journal j → journal anchor ON anchor.JournalID = j.ProducedByOperationJournalID`. There is therefore no `{ProducedByOperationJournalID} → {ActorID}` data dependency held *within* `journal` at all: the determinant column is populated on exactly the rows whose `ActorID` is NULL, so the stored relation carries no repeated actor to depend on. `JournalID` is a surrogate with no other functional source (two rows may legitimately share identical `(JournalKind, ActorID, RecordedAt)`, e.g. a timestamp collision or two same-actor anchors in the same batch).

**Candidate keys:** `{JournalID}` only.

**Primary key:** `JournalID`.

**Foreign keys:** `JournalKind → journal_kinds(id)`; `ActorID → agents(id)`; `ProducedByOperationJournalID → journal_operations(JournalID)`.

**Committing-actor model.** The *committing* actor of an operation — the actor who executed the operation, not necessarily the domain subject of the effect — is recorded **once**, on the operation's anchor row. Every subordinate row the operation produces derives that same committing actor from the anchor (§8.5); it is never restamped on the produced row. A responsibility-slot occupant is carried separately on `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.ActorID` (§4.4) and may differ from the committing actor (a Pasture-system actor executing a transfer or a migration on behalf of an occupant, §13).

**BCNF.** The surrogate `{JournalID}` is the only candidate key, and every FD on `journal` — `{JournalID} → {JournalKind, ActorID, RecordedAt, ProducedByOperationJournalID}` — has that candidate key as its determinant, so **`journal` is in BCNF with no decomposition and no controlled redundancy**. This is the point of storing `ActorID` on anchor rows only: the earlier design that repeated each produced row's committing `ActorID` alongside its `ProducedByOperationJournalID` introduced the non-key FD `{ProducedByOperationJournalID} → {ActorID}` and the corresponding agreement obligation; removing the repeated column removes both. Actor–anchor *disagreement* is now structurally impossible — a subordinate row has no actor column to disagree with — rather than something a reducer invariant must forbid. The one placement invariant that remains (`ActorID NOT NULL` exactly on anchor rows) is expressed directly by a `CHECK` constraint and re-checked by [§10 rule 5](#10-totality-rules); its must-fail history is `authority_evidence.yaml` / `subordinate-row-carrying-actor-rejected`.

This one column — `ProducedByOperationJournalID` — is the structural fix for
the salvage regression where a superseded implementation stored operation
result closure as `committed_operations.event_ids_json`, a JSON list that
could drift from the actual `task_events.operation_id` foreign keys (caught
by that implementation's own `TestIntegratedGateRejectsExactSchemaAndFullEventClosureDrift`).
Under this contract there is exactly one place an operation's effect closure
is recorded — this foreign key — so drift between "what the operation says it
produced" and "what actually exists" is structurally impossible, not merely
checked. An operation's full result is the query
`SELECT * FROM journal WHERE ProducedByOperationJournalID = :anchor ORDER BY JournalID`,
joined out to each row's typed subtype table by `JournalKind`. This flat,
ordered closure is exactly what reconstructs `CommittedExact.EmittedEvents`
(the non-slot-keyed `[]EventID`). The *slot-keyed* portion of a committed
result — `CanonicalMutationResult`'s caller-chosen local handles mapped to
concrete IDs — needs one further column that this closure does not carry (which
slot name the caller used for each produced row); that mapping is persisted by
`journal_operation_result_slots` (§3.2).

### 2.2 `journal_kinds` (closed lookup)

`(id INTEGER PK, name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL)`, seeded with exactly:
`operation`, `task_event`, `authority`, `decision`, `evidence`. FD `{id} ↔
{name}` (both directions since `name` is `UNIQUE NOT NULL`); two candidate
keys `{id}`, `{name}`; PK `id`; trivially BCNF (single non-key attribute,
determined by either key, no other dependency). This is the same closed-enum
shape as the existing `statuses`/`priorities`/`task_types`/`edge_kinds`
tables and is not repeated in detail for the other closed-enum lookup tables
introduced below (`authority_kinds`, `assignment_slots`,
`assignment_transitions`): each has identical shape and identical BCNF
argument, differing only in which values are seeded.

## 3. Committed operations

### 3.1 `journal_operations`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | PK; the operation's own anchor row |
| `OperationID` | `TEXT` | no | caller-supplied alternate key, `UNIQUE` |
| `AuthorityJournalID` | FK → `journal_authorities.JournalID` | yes | the authority this operation executed under; NULL **only** on a genesis operation whose sole effect is producing one `bootstrap` authority — see [§4.6](#46-genesis-the-authority-base-case) |
| `CommandDigest` | `BLOB` | no | opaque caller-domain digest of the closed command |
| `MutationDigest` | `BLOB` | no | Provenance-derived structural digest, independent of `CommandDigest` |

**Functional dependencies:** `{JournalID} → {OperationID, AuthorityJournalID, CommandDigest, MutationDigest}` and, since `OperationID` is `UNIQUE NOT NULL` and this table has exactly one row per operation, `{OperationID} → {JournalID, AuthorityJournalID, CommandDigest, MutationDigest}`.

**Candidate keys:** `{JournalID}`, `{OperationID}`.

**Primary key:** `JournalID` — consistent with the class-table-inheritance convention used across every journal subtype. `OperationID` is the alternate key: it is **never** the primary key and is **never** an ordering source (see [§6](#6-operationid-doctrine)).

**Foreign keys:** `JournalID → journal(JournalID)`; `AuthorityJournalID → journal_authorities(JournalID)`.

**BCNF:** with two single-attribute candidate keys and no non-key attribute functionally determining a proper subset of the other key's attributes, `journal_operations` is in BCNF without decomposition.

`(ActorID, AuthorityJournalID, CommandDigest, MutationDigest)` — the *exact
replay identity* — is **not** a schema-level uniqueness constraint on this
table; it is an equality check the reducer performs at lookup time against
whatever row already carries the proposed `OperationID` (see
[§9.4](#94-idempotent-replay-short-circuit)). Declaring it `UNIQUE` would
incorrectly forbid two unrelated operations from coincidentally producing
identical digests under different `OperationID`s, which is not itself an
error.

### 3.2 `journal_operation_result_slots`

`LookupCommitted` must return, for a committed operation, its
`CanonicalMutationResult` — the caller-chosen local handle name for each thing
the operation allocated (`CanonicalTaskResult{Slot ResultSlotID; ID TaskID}`,
and its `Assignment`/`Activity`/`Event` siblings), mapped to the concrete ID it
resolved to. Canonical typed local handles let later mutations in one batch
reference earlier allocations, and the replay-stable result maps every handle to
its concrete ID. This mapping is **not** reconstructable from the §2.1
`ProducedByOperationJournalID` closure (which enumerates *which* rows an
operation produced but records no slot name), from the one-way
`CommandDigest`/`MutationDigest` (not reversible), or from `LookupCommitted`'s
own `OperationLookupIdentity{Actor, Authority, Command}` signature (which cannot
resupply the original slot list) — so it must be durably persisted at
Apply-commit time:

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal_operations.JournalID` | no | part of PK; the producing operation's anchor |
| `ResultSlotID` | `TEXT` | no | part of PK; the caller's local handle name (e.g. `new-task-1`) |
| `ProducedJournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | the concrete produced row this slot resolved to |

**FD:** `{JournalID, ResultSlotID} → {ProducedJournalID}`. In addition, an
induced FD `{ProducedJournalID} → {JournalID}` holds over the whole relation,
*given* the own-operation integrity invariant below: `ProducedJournalID`
identifies a `journal` row, and that row's own
`ProducedByOperationJournalID` (§2.1) is fixed the moment the row is
produced, so once a slot row names a `ProducedJournalID`, the `JournalID`
determined by that produced row's `ProducedByOperationJournalID` is fixed
too — the same derive-`JournalID`-from-the-produced-row's-`PBOJID`
relationship used for the near-key FD in §4.4. This is a genuine functional
dependency, not merely a restated foreign key: it holds because of the
invariant, not because of the FK alone (the two FKs, `JournalID →
journal_operations` and `ProducedJournalID → journal`, are independently
satisfiable by a slot row whose `ProducedJournalID` points at a row produced
by some *other* operation).

**Own-operation integrity invariant (reducer-enforced):** a slot row's
`ProducedJournalID` must identify a `journal` row whose own
`ProducedByOperationJournalID` equals the slot row's own `JournalID` — i.e. a
result slot may only map to a row produced by *its own* operation, never to a
row produced by a different operation. Referential integrity alone (the two
FKs above) cannot express this — it guarantees `ProducedJournalID` and
`JournalID` each reference an *existing* row, not that they name the *same*
operation. Left unenforced, a slot row could point at another operation's
produced row, which would corrupt that operation's reconstructed
`CanonicalMutationResult` (the §3.2 reconstruction query filters
`WHERE JournalID = :anchor` and returns whatever `ProducedJournalID` sits in
that row, trusting it belongs to the anchor's own operation). This is a
reducer-level business rule the schema cannot express, in the same §14.3
pattern as orphaned-evidence rejection: checked and rejected before commit,
not merely assumed from the FKs. Codified as totality rule 9 (§10).

**Candidate key / PK:** `{JournalID, ResultSlotID}`. Whether `ProducedJournalID`
is itself a second candidate key depends on whether slot-aliasing (two
`ResultSlotID`s within one operation resolving to the same `ProducedJournalID`)
is permitted; this contract permits it (a caller may legitimately reference
the same allocated row under two local handles), so `ProducedJournalID` is
**not** `UNIQUE` and is **not** a second candidate key. Under that choice,
`{ProducedJournalID} → {JournalID}` is a nontrivial FD whose determinant is
not a superkey, pinned by the own-operation integrity invariant above rather
than decomposed away. This is the schema's **one** deliberate controlled
denormalization: unlike §2.1's actor column — which is now stored on anchor
rows only, so `journal` needs no controlled redundancy and no agreement
invariant at all — a result-slot row genuinely needs `JournalID` (its owning
operation anchor) present locally to key the slot, and the derived
`{ProducedJournalID} → {JournalID}` relationship cannot be normalized away
without losing that key. **BCNF:** not strictly satisfied on
`{ProducedJournalID} → {JournalID}` for the reason just given; accepted as
controlled redundancy with the required agreement enforced as the reducer
invariant of §10 rule 9 rather than a normal-form decomposition.

`CanonicalMutationResult` reconstructs as `SELECT ResultSlotID,
ProducedJournalID, JournalKind FROM journal_operation_result_slots JOIN journal
ON ProducedJournalID = journal.JournalID WHERE
journal_operation_result_slots.JournalID = :anchor`, bucketed into
`Tasks`/`Assignments`/`Activities`/`Events` by `JournalKind`. `EmittedEvents`
(the flat, non-slot-keyed ordered event list) needs no row here — it is fully
covered by the §2.1 `ProducedByOperationJournalID` closure. `operation_results.yaml`
carries the slot-reconstruction histories.

## 4. Authority lifecycle

### 4.1 `authority_kinds` (closed lookup)

Values: `bootstrap`, `assignment`. Same shape/BCNF argument as `journal_kinds`.

### 4.2 `journal_authorities`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | PK |
| `AuthorityKind` | FK → `authority_kinds.id` | no | `bootstrap` \| `assignment` |
| `OperationAuthorityID` | `TEXT` | no | opaque alternate key, `UNIQUE`, used as `MutationContext.Authority` |

**FDs:** `{JournalID} → {AuthorityKind, OperationAuthorityID}`; `{OperationAuthorityID} → {JournalID, AuthorityKind}`.

**Candidate keys:** `{JournalID}`, `{OperationAuthorityID}`. **PK:** `JournalID`. **BCNF:** trivial (single non-key attribute, determined identically by either key).

### 4.3 `journal_authority_bootstraps`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal_authorities.JournalID` | no | PK |
| `Label` | `TEXT` | no | operator-facing bootstrap identity name |

**FD:** `{JournalID} → {Label}`. **Candidate key / PK:** `{JournalID}`. **BCNF:** trivial (single key, single non-key attribute).

### 4.4 Assignment lifecycle — a worked BCNF decomposition

A naive single-table design for "who holds which responsibility slot on
which task" looks like this, folding every lifecycle transition (start, end)
into one row per occupancy episode:

```
journal_authority_assignments_NAIVE(
    JournalID PK,
    AssignmentID,      -- stable episode identity
    Transition,         -- 'started' | 'ended'
    TaskID,
    SlotID,
    ActorID,
    PredecessorAssignmentID,
    ParentAssignmentID
)
```

This table has two candidate keys: `{JournalID}` (every transition is its own
journal row, so it always gets a fresh `JournalID`) and `{AssignmentID,
Transition}` (an episode has at most one `started` row and at most one `ended`
row, enforced by `UNIQUE(AssignmentID, Transition)`).

It is **not** in BCNF. `TaskID`, `SlotID`, `ActorID`,
`PredecessorAssignmentID`, and `ParentAssignmentID` are invariant for the
whole episode — a responsibility-assignment episode cannot change which task,
slot, actor, predecessor, or governing parent it concerns between its
`started` and `ended` rows; a change of task/slot/actor is by definition a
**new** episode (a transfer), not a mutation of the old one. That gives the
nontrivial FD

```
{AssignmentID} → {TaskID, SlotID, ActorID, PredecessorAssignmentID, ParentAssignmentID}
```

whose left side, `{AssignmentID}` alone, is **not** a superkey of this table
(the real candidate key needs `Transition` too). This is a textbook BCNF
violation: a determinant that is a proper subset of a candidate key.

**Decomposition** (lossless, dependency-preserving — `AssignmentID` is a
candidate key of the first table below, so it is a superkey of the split,
which guarantees a lossless join per the standard BCNF decomposition
theorem; it is dependency-preserving because each original FD lands wholly
within one component — `{AssignmentID} → {TaskID, SlotID, ActorID,
PredecessorAssignmentID, ParentAssignmentID}` in the episodes table and
`{AssignmentID, Transition} → {JournalID}` in the transitions table — and
`{JournalID} →` the remaining
attributes is then recoverable by transitivity through those preserved FDs, so
no dependency is lost across the split):

**`journal_authority_assignment_episodes`**

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AssignmentID` | `TEXT` | no | PK — stable identity of one occupancy episode |
| `TaskID` | FK → `tasks.id` | no | the task the responsibility slot is on |
| `SlotID` | FK → `assignment_slots.id` | no | e.g. `owner-responsibility`; extensible for future slots |
| `ActorID` | FK → `agents.id` | no | the actor holding (or having held) the slot for this episode |
| `PredecessorAssignmentID` | FK → `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.AssignmentID`, self | yes | the episode this one **succeeds**, for a CAS transfer; `UNIQUE` — see [§8.2](#82-single-consumption-ownership-assignment-evidence) |
| `ParentAssignmentID` | FK → `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.AssignmentID`, self | yes | the episode this one **is deliberately rooted under**, cited at start for delegated governance (§14.5); NOT `UNIQUE` — one parent may be cited by many children. Distinct from `PredecessorAssignmentID` (see below) |

**`PredecessorAssignmentID` vs `ParentAssignmentID`.** These are two different
self-references with different meanings. `PredecessorAssignmentID` is a
*succession* edge along the **time** axis: the new episode replaces an ended
episode on the *same* responsibility slot of the *same* task (a transfer), and
it is `UNIQUE` because an ended episode is succeeded by at most one successor
(§14.2). `ParentAssignmentID` is a *governance-citation* edge along the
**ownership** axis: the new episode declares which other, still-active episode
deliberately authorizes it — typically an episode on a *different* (higher)
task — and it is not `UNIQUE` because one parent can delegate to many children.
A given episode may carry both (it both succeeds a predecessor and is rooted
under a parent), one, or neither. The governance predicate reads
`ParentAssignmentID`; the transfer/single-consumption rules read
`PredecessorAssignmentID` (§14.5, §14.2).

FDs: `{AssignmentID} → {TaskID, SlotID, ActorID, PredecessorAssignmentID, ParentAssignmentID}`;
and, over rows with `PredecessorAssignmentID` NOT NULL, the near-key
partial-function dependency `{PredecessorAssignmentID} → {AssignmentID, TaskID,
SlotID, ActorID}` induced by the `UNIQUE(PredecessorAssignmentID)` constraint
(§14.2). `ParentAssignmentID` carries no `UNIQUE` constraint, so it induces no
near-key dependency and adds no candidate key. A nullable `UNIQUE` column is
not a candidate key in the strict relational sense — NULLs are permitted and
are not compared equal — so it adds no candidate key and leaves BCNF
unaffected. Candidate key / PK: `{AssignmentID}`. BCNF: trivial — the sole
candidate key `{AssignmentID}` is literally the whole-episode identity; every
FD determinant here is either `{AssignmentID}` itself (which determines
`ParentAssignmentID` along with every other episode attribute) or the near-key
`{PredecessorAssignmentID}`, and the latter determines exactly the attributes a
candidate key would, so no determinant is a proper subset of a key.

**`journal_authority_assignment_transitions`**

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal_authorities.JournalID` | no | PK |
| `AssignmentID` | FK → `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.AssignmentID` | no | which episode this transition belongs to |
| `Transition` | FK → `assignment_transitions.id` | no | `started` \| `ended`; `UNIQUE(AssignmentID, Transition)` |

FDs: `{JournalID} → {AssignmentID, Transition}`; `{AssignmentID, Transition} →
{JournalID}`. Candidate keys: `{JournalID}`, `{AssignmentID, Transition}`. PK:
`JournalID`. BCNF: trivial — two keys, no other attribute, no non-key
determinant.

A "transfer" (CAS ownership change) is two writes inside one operation: an
`ended` transition on the old `AssignmentID`, and a `started` transition on a
**new** `AssignmentID` whose `PredecessorAssignmentID` is the old one. Nothing
about an episode row is ever updated in place after creation — the table is
append-only, matching the journal's own append-only discipline. "Current
occupant of slot `X` on task `Y`" is a *projection*, computed as: among
episodes for `(TaskID=Y, SlotID=X)` that have a `started` transition and no
`ended` transition, the one whose `started` transition has the greatest
`JournalID`. It is not stored as a mutable column anywhere.

### 4.5 `assignment_slots`, `assignment_transitions` (closed lookups)

`assignment_slots` seeds at minimum `owner-responsibility`, extensible for
future non-owner slots without a schema change. `assignment_transitions`
seeds exactly `started`, `ended`. Same shape/BCNF argument as §2.2.

### 4.6 Genesis: the authority base case

Totality rule 2 (§10) makes every non-anchor journal row cite a producing
operation, and §3.1 makes every operation cite an executing authority. Treated
as *universal* NOT NULL constraints these two rules have **no base case**: the
first authority could never be produced (its producing operation would itself
need a prior authority), and the first operation could never execute (it would
need a prior authority to already exist) — a genuine foreign-key cycle
(`journal.ProducedByOperationJournalID → journal_operations →
journal_operations.AuthorityJournalID → journal_authorities → journal`) that no
insert order satisfies under immediate FK checking. The contract breaks this
cycle with exactly one narrow base case, mirroring the
`ProducedByOperationJournalID` NULL-only-on-anchor pattern of §2.1:

- **A genesis operation** is a `journal_operations` row with
  `AuthorityJournalID = NULL`. It is the **only** row in the whole schema
  permitted a NULL `AuthorityJournalID`. Its sole permitted effect is producing
  exactly one `journal_authorities` row with `AuthorityKind = 'bootstrap'`
  (with its `journal_authority_bootstraps` detail row). It produces no task
  events, no assignment transitions, no decisions, and no evidence.
- The bootstrap authority the genesis operation produces is an ordinary effect
  row: its `journal.ProducedByOperationJournalID` is the genesis operation's own
  `JournalID`, so **totality rule 2 stays universal** — every authority,
  including the first, is produced by exactly one operation. Only
  `AuthorityJournalID`'s NOT NULL requirement is relaxed, and only for the
  genesis operation.
- **Legal insert order** (immediate FK checking; no deferred constraints
  required): (1) insert the genesis operation's `journal` anchor row
  (`ProducedByOperationJournalID = NULL`); (2) insert its `journal_operations`
  row (`AuthorityJournalID = NULL`); (3) insert the bootstrap authority's
  `journal` row (`ProducedByOperationJournalID` = the genesis operation's
  `JournalID`); (4) insert its `journal_authorities` and
  `journal_authority_bootstraps` rows. No foreign key is ever unsatisfied at
  insert time, so **no `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys` or deferred-constraint
  mechanism is needed** — this is a stated schema property, not an incidental
  one.
- **A genesis operation is accepted only when no `journal_operations` row yet
  exists** — i.e. it is the first operation in the journal. This closes the
  obvious hole: were arbitrary NULL-authority operations allowed, any caller
  could mint a bootstrap authority under no authorization. Reducer invariants
  §10 rules 6–7 enforce the NULL-only-on-genesis, first-operation-only, and
  sole-bootstrap-effect rules.
- **Precedence vs. §9.4's idempotent short-circuit.** The genesis operation
  has an `OperationID` like any other operation, so a legitimate retry of it
  (e.g. a network retry of first-boot, same `OperationID`, arriving after the
  bootstrap authority already committed) is presented against a
  now-non-empty journal. §9.4's `OperationID`-presence check is evaluated
  **before** the "no `journal_operations` row yet exists" genesis-validity
  check above: if `journal_operations` already holds a row for the proposed
  `OperationID`, §9.4's four-field identity short-circuit fires first and
  returns the original bootstrap authority unchanged — the genesis-validity
  check above is never reached for that operation. The genesis-validity
  check only ever rejects a genesis presenting a **new** (not-yet-seen)
  `OperationID` against a non-empty journal — i.e. a distinct, illegitimate
  second bootstrap attempt, not an idempotent retry of the first one. See
  §9.4 and §10 rule 6 for the corresponding cross-references.
- **Migration (§13) executes under a bootstrap authority.** A migration run
  first establishes (or requires already-established) the `pasture-system`
  bootstrap authority via one genesis operation as above; every per-task
  baseline anchor operation it then writes is an ordinary non-genesis operation
  whose `AuthorityJournalID` is NOT NULL and equal to that bootstrap authority's
  `JournalID`. Migration never writes a NULL-authority operation except the
  single genesis operation, and never fabricates an authority.

`genesis_bootstrap.yaml` carries the must-pass genesis history, the
same-`OperationID` genesis-retry-hits-§9.4-short-circuit must-pass history, and
the must-fail histories (NULL authority on a non-genesis operation, a second
genesis against a non-empty journal, and a genesis producing a non-bootstrap
effect).

## 5. Task and domain events

### 5.1 `journal_task_events`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | PK |
| `TaskID` | FK → `tasks.id` | no | |
| `EventKind` | `TEXT` (namespaced, validated) | no | e.g. `provenance.task.created`, `pasture.review.recorded` |
| `Payload` | `TEXT` (`json_valid` CHECK) | no | opaque; Provenance validates envelope shape only, never caller-domain fields |

**FD:** `{JournalID} → {TaskID, EventKind, Payload}`. **Candidate key / PK:** `{JournalID}` — no other candidate key exists; many events legitimately share identical `(TaskID, EventKind)` (e.g. two `task.updated` events on the same task). **BCNF:** trivial.

`EventKind` is deliberately a validated namespaced `TEXT` column, not an FK
into a closed lookup table: Pasture and future callers define their own
kinds (`pasture.review.recorded`) that Provenance never enumerates in
advance. This is the same open/closed distinction the historical `#4` body
already drew, carried forward unchanged.

**Fixed-mapping lifecycle kinds (`StatusForEventKind`).** A small **closed** set of
`provenance.*` event kinds are the reducer's status-lifecycle vocabulary: their
projection onto `tasks.status_id` is a fixed mapping, not an open payload read —
`provenance.task.created`, `provenance.task.reopened`, and `provenance.task.stopped`
→ `open`, `provenance.task.started` → `in_progress`, `provenance.task.closed` →
`closed`. Any other `EventKind` (a caller-domain event) leaves status unchanged.
`in_progress` is reachable natively **only** via `provenance.task.started` (added by
`#5` as the completion of §15's status-divergence forward pointer, under §8.1's own
"route that status change through a journal lifecycle event once the direct-write path
retires" authority — not an open reversal of the ratified status model); the only
other route to a non-`open` baseline is a migration marker's captured legacy status
(§13). `provenance.task.stopped` is the `#5` lifecycle kind for the `in_progress` →
`open` transition (`Session.Stop`) — halting active work without closing — added under
the same authority. The generalized "status-from-payload" alternative was **rejected**
to keep the lifecycle vocabulary a closed, statically-typed fixed mapping rather than
an interpreted payload channel.

Two kinds (`reopened`, `stopped`) share the `→ open` target; they are NOT
disambiguated by the target status but by the **static status FSM** (§8.1), which fixes
the legal *source* status of each transition kind — `stopped` only from `in_progress`,
`reopened` only from `closed` — so the fixed target mapping and the source rule together
keep every transition kind's meaning unambiguous.

### 5.2 `journal_task_event_contexts`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EventJournalID` | FK → `journal_task_events.JournalID` | no | part of PK |
| `ContextKind` | `TEXT` | no | part of PK; built-in (`task`/`activity`/`actor`/`git`) or caller-extension namespaced |
| `ContextIdentity` | `TEXT` | no | part of PK; encoded identity string |
| `AttachedByJournalID` | FK → `journal_task_events.JournalID` | no | the (possibly later) event that attached this edge |

**FD:** `{EventJournalID, ContextKind, ContextIdentity} → {AttachedByJournalID}`. One event may have many context edges attached by many different later events, so no proper subset of the key determines `AttachedByJournalID`. **Candidate key / PK:** the full triple. **BCNF:** trivial (single key). The row is written exactly once (`INSERT`, never `UPDATE`) — the first event to attach a given `(EventJournalID, ContextKind, ContextIdentity)` edge owns `AttachedByJournalID` permanently; a later attempt to attach the identical edge is a no-op, not a pointer move. This is what lets a snapshot query bound visibility by `AttachedByJournalID <= watermark` and get a reproducible answer regardless of when the read happens.

Context sets are canonicalized and deduplicated by `(ContextKind,
ContextIdentity)` at construction, exactly as in the salvage
`CanonicalEventContexts` implementation, which is carried forward unchanged
in behavior (validate-then-sort-then-dedup, sort key `(kind, identity)`
lexical order).

`ContextKind` mixes built-in values the reducer *interprets* for
identity-encoding validation (`task`/`activity`/`actor`/`git`) with open
caller-extension namespaces it records opaquely. The column is open-in-storage
but the built-in list is closed-in-behavior. The criterion that keeps
`JournalKind`/`AuthorityKind`/`Transition`/`SlotID` closed integer lookups
(§2.2) is precisely *whether the schema or reducer dispatches on the value*: an
open kind flows through Provenance opaquely, so it stays validated `TEXT`. If a
future slice ever adds an attribute that functionally depends on a specific
built-in `ContextKind` value — i.e. the reducer or schema begins to dispatch on
it beyond identity-encoding validation — that value set **graduates to a closed
integer lookup at that point**, by that same criterion.

## 6. Decisions and material-work evidence

### 6.1 `journal_decisions`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | PK |
| `DecisionKind` | `TEXT` (namespaced, validated) | no | e.g. `pasture.review.vote`, `pasture.uat.verdict` |
| `TaskID` | FK → `tasks.id` | yes | a decision need not be scoped to one task |
| `Payload` | `TEXT` (`json_valid` CHECK) | no | opaque, caller-validated |

**FD:** `{JournalID} → {DecisionKind, TaskID, Payload}`. **Candidate key / PK:** `{JournalID}`. **BCNF:** trivial. `DecisionKind` and `Payload` follow the same open/opaque doctrine as `EventKind`/`Payload` in §5.1 — Provenance records the fact of a decision; it never interprets Pasture's verdict vocabulary.

### 6.2 `journal_evidence`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | PK |
| `EvidenceKind` | `TEXT` (namespaced, validated) | no | e.g. `pasture.git.commit`, `provenance.snapshot.created` |
| `TaskID` | FK → `tasks.id` | yes | |
| `ContentDigest` | `BLOB` | no | canonical digest of the evidence payload (e.g. a `GitOID` or content hash) |
| `Payload` | `TEXT` (`json_valid` CHECK) | no | opaque |

**FD:** `{JournalID} → {EvidenceKind, TaskID, ContentDigest, Payload}`. **Candidate key / PK:** `{JournalID}`. **BCNF:** trivial.

### 6.2.1 Subtype-owned fact contexts

Decision and evidence facts carry immutable canonical context sets in exactly two
relations. Contexts are owned by the fact subtype row, not by
`journal_task_event_contexts`, and are written in the same operation transaction
as their parent fact:

**`journal_decision_contexts`**

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DecisionJournalID` | FK → `journal_decisions.JournalID` | no | part of PK; immutable decision parent |
| `ContextKind` | `TEXT` | no | part of PK; same validated open context-kind domain as §5.2 |
| `ContextIdentity` | `TEXT` | no | part of PK; encoded identity string |

**`journal_evidence_contexts`** has the identical shape with
`EvidenceJournalID` as an FK to `journal_evidence.JournalID`.

Each relation is `STRICT, WITHOUT ROWID` with primary key
`{ParentJournalID, ContextKind, ContextIdentity}`. The subtype FK statically
prevents a decision context from being attached to an evidence row (and vice
versa); no generic nullable-parent relation, discriminator, trigger, or
`AttachedByJournalID` is used. Since a fact's parent `JournalID` fixes its
snapshot visibility, fact contexts are not later attached and have no separate
attachment position. Context sets are validate-then-sort-then-deduplicated by
`(ContextKind, ContextIdentity)` as defined in §5.2.

**FD / BCNF:** `{ParentJournalID, ContextKind, ContextIdentity} → {}`. The full
triple is the only candidate key, so each relation is in BCNF. For a canonical
operation, the stored set must equal the context set encoded in that operation's
effect; missing, extra, malformed, cross-subtype, or opaque-legacy context rows
are integrity violations and fail closed.

### 6.3 `immutable_tasks`

`CreateImmutableTaskSnapshot` (the generic snapshot command from the
historical `#5` body) is one `journal_evidence` row with `EvidenceKind =
'provenance.snapshot.created'` plus a marker row here:

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TaskID` | FK → `tasks.id` | no | PK |
| `SnapshotEvidenceJournalID` | FK → `journal_evidence.JournalID` | no | `UNIQUE` |

**FDs:** `{TaskID} → {SnapshotEvidenceJournalID}`; `{SnapshotEvidenceJournalID} → {TaskID}` (one evidence row creates at most one immutable task). **Candidate keys:** `{TaskID}`, `{SnapshotEvidenceJournalID}`. **PK:** `TaskID`. **BCNF:** trivial.

The reducer consults this table's presence, not any status field, before
accepting an `update`/`status`/`phase`/`owner`/`assignment`/`close`/`reopen`
mutation against a `TaskID`: presence of a row rejects the mutation
outright. A snapshot task remains an ordinary `TaskID` for relationship
targets (attribution, evidence) — the listed lifecycle mutation families
are closed off.

### 6.4 Journaled relationship/annotation mutation families (`#5` amendment)

**Amendment (reductive).** Earlier drafts classified typed dependency **edges**,
**labels**, and **comments** as un-journaled *relationship/annotation targets* outside the
journal's mutation-family scope — the journal recorded only the task-lifecycle families
(create/update/status/close/reopen) plus authority/decision/evidence, and the Session
exposed the five relationship/annotation verbs as honest un-journaled direct writes. That
classification is **superseded**: per the recorded UAT Gate-1 ruling ("edges, labels, and
comments should become journaled — this would enable who-provenance"), edge-add,
edge-remove, label-add, label-remove, and comment-add are now **first-class journaled
mutation families**. The "relationship-target-only, un-journaled" classification of
edges/labels/comments — and the §16 un-journaled disclosure that documented it — are
**void**. What is NOT changed: §14.5 (a `blocked_by` edge grants no ownership authority)
stands unchanged — an edge's *creation* is now journaled, but the edge still delegates no
authority (see §14.5).

**Shape (fixed-kind pattern).** Each family is journaled ON a `journal_task_events` row
(§5.1) carrying a **fixed per-family `EventKind`** — `provenance.edge.added`,
`provenance.edge.removed`, `provenance.label.added`, `provenance.label.removed`,
`provenance.comment.added` — never a payload-generalized dispatch (the same closed-kind
discipline as the lifecycle kinds, §5.1, and the Gate-2 FSM precedent). The row's `TaskID`
is the **source/subject** task; it is authorized against the operation's authority at the
effect's own `JournalID` exactly like any task event (§9.3), and attributed to the
committing actor (§8.2). The operands live in the row **payload**, encoded from closed
shapes:

| Family kind | Payload FD (operands) |
|---|---|
| `provenance.edge.added` / `provenance.edge.removed` | `{JournalID} → {Target, EdgeKind}` |
| `provenance.label.added` / `provenance.label.removed` | `{JournalID} → {Label}` |
| `provenance.comment.added` | `{JournalID} → {CommentID, Author, Body}` |

The `journal_task_events` PK/BCNF of §5.1 applies unchanged (candidate key `{JournalID}`;
`EventKind`/`Payload` opaque-to-the-supertype). **Who-provenance** is therefore
journal-derivable: *who* added/removed a relationship (the anchor's committing actor),
*under which authority* (the producing operation's `AuthorityJournalID`, §3.1), *at which
position* (the row's `JournalID`), and *what* (the payload operands).

**Domain projections (BCNF, re-derivable).** The `edges`, `labels`, and `comments` base
tables are now **shared-reducer projections** — the current materialization of the
journaled families — exactly as `tasks` (§8.1) is the projection of the lifecycle events.
The shared reducer step folds each family row into its projection (an edge-add `INSERT`, an
edge-remove `DELETE`, and so on), and the §15 from-empty convergence check covers them: a
full replay re-derives the identical `edges`/`labels`/`comments` sets from ordered journal
history. Their keys are unchanged — `edges{SourceID, TargetID, EdgeKind}`,
`labels{TaskID, Name}`, `comments{CommentID}` (with FD `{CommentID} → {TaskID, Author,
Body, CreatedAt}`). A `blocked_by` edge-add is **cycle-checked in the reducer fold** before
it commits (the graph store reads the same `edges` projection, so a cycle-free journal
keeps the graph acyclic); the comment's `CommentID` is minted once by the caller and
carried in the payload so a replay reproduces the SAME id.

## 7. Actor domain

The existing `agents` / `agents_human` / `agents_ml` / `agents_software`
table-per-type hierarchy is carried forward unchanged in shape. `ActorID` is
the Go-level typed domain name over the same `namespace--uuidv7` wire format
already stored in `agents.id`; `AgentID` remains a deprecated source-level
alias for one coordinated release, not a second column or a second identity
domain. No schema change is required here beyond what §7.1–7.2 add.

### 7.1 `actor_namespace_claims`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Namespace` | `TEXT` | no | PK |
| `ClaimantID` | `TEXT` | no | opaque claimant identity, e.g. `pasture-system` |
| `RangeMin` | `BLOB(16)` | no | inclusive lower bound of the claimed fixed-UUID range |
| `RangeMax` | `BLOB(16)` | no | inclusive upper bound |
| `Codec` | `TEXT` | no | the ordinal→UUID encoding this claimant uses within its range |

**FD:** `{Namespace} → {ClaimantID, RangeMin, RangeMax, Codec}`. **Candidate key / PK:** `{Namespace}`. **BCNF:** trivial.

A claim is idempotent only when a re-registration exactly matches the stored
`(ClaimantID, RangeMin, RangeMax, Codec)`; the `PRIMARY KEY(Namespace)`
constraint alone forces any differing re-registration to be an explicit
application-level conflict, not a silent overwrite — the reducer must
compare-then-reject, since SQL alone can express "at most one row per
namespace" but not "and it must match."

### 7.2 `fixed_actor_manifest_entries`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ActorID` | FK → `agents.id` | no | PK |
| `Namespace` | FK → `actor_namespace_claims.Namespace` | no | |
| `ActorKind` | FK → `agent_kinds.id` | no | |
| `Name` | `TEXT` | no | `UNIQUE(Namespace, Name)` |
| `Metadata` | `TEXT` (`json_valid` CHECK) | no | |

**FDs:** `{ActorID} → {Namespace, ActorKind, Name, Metadata}` (globally unique); `{Namespace, Name} → {ActorID, ActorKind, Metadata}`. **Candidate keys:** `{ActorID}`, `{Namespace, Name}`. **PK:** `ActorID`. **BCNF:** trivial — two keys, no attribute outside either key determines a proper subset of the other.

**System namespace reservation.** Pasture claims `Namespace = 'pasture-system'`
via one `actor_namespace_claims` row (`dayvidpham/pasture#14`, historical `#5`
body). Its `Codec` deterministically maps small ordinals to UUIDs within
`[RangeMin, RangeMax]`; "actor IDs 0–1023 reserved, actor 0 is the default
Pasture system identity" (the amendment's shorthand) means ordinals 0–1023 of
that codec, with ordinal 0 pre-registered as a `fixed_actor_manifest_entries`
row before any other Pasture activity can reference it. Provenance's registry
here is generic — it stores a claimant, a range, and a codec name, never
Pasture's specific ordinal-to-name mapping — so `EnsureActorNamespaceManifest`
and `FixedActorSpec` (historical `#5` body) remain implementable directly on
top of these two relations without Provenance embedding any Pasture name or
semantics.

### 7.3 Namespace-claim integrity (reducer rules)

Two properties the schema cannot express structurally are enforced by the
reducer, documented here per the §14.3 convention so the proof corpus carries a
dedicated negative case for each:

1. **Non-overlapping ranges.** A new `actor_namespace_claims` row whose
   `[RangeMin, RangeMax]` intersects the range of any existing claim is rejected
   before commit, with an actionable error naming **both** the new and the
   conflicting namespace. `PRIMARY KEY(Namespace)` prevents duplicate namespace
   *names* but cannot express range disjointness across different names, so an
   unchecked overlap would surface only later as an accidental
   `fixed_actor_manifest_entries`/`agents` primary-key collision, with no
   diagnostic tying it back to the two conflicting claims.
2. **Entry-in-range.** A `fixed_actor_manifest_entries` row's `ActorID` must
   decode, via its namespace's `Codec`, to an ordinal lying within that
   namespace's `[RangeMin, RangeMax]`; an entry whose `ActorID` falls outside
   its claimed range (or does not decode under the claimed codec) is rejected.
   The `Namespace` foreign key guarantees the claim *exists* but cannot express
   that the entry actually belongs inside the claimed range.

`actor_namespace.yaml` carries a must-fail overlap history and a must-fail
out-of-range entry history (plus a must-pass disjoint-claims history).

## 8. Projections

Projections are the *only* relations this contract allows to be read as
"current state" outside the journal itself. Every one of them must be a pure,
reproducible function of ordered journal history up to some watermark — see
[§9](#9-shared-reducer-contract) for the reducer contract that maintains
them.

### 8.1 `tasks` (existing table, reused as the current-state projection)

The existing `tasks` table (`id`, `status_id`, `priority_id`, `type_id`,
`phase_id`, `owner_id`, …) is retained verbatim as the current-task-state
projection, with one addition:

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LastJournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | the watermark this row's derived state reflects |

This column is not user-facing; it lets `Open`'s replay verify convergence
("does the stored projection match `Reduce(history, LastJournalID)`?") and
lets audit tooling confirm a row reflects journal history up to and including
`LastJournalID` and nothing beyond. `owner_id` on this table is written
**exclusively** by the shared reducer (§9), never by a direct `UPDATE`
outside `Apply`/`Open` — it is the "current occupant of the
`owner-responsibility` slot" projection described in §4.4, materialized here
for query convenience rather than recomputed from `journal_authority_assignment_episodes`
on every read.

**S1.1 → S1.3 staging note — RESOLVED (`dayvidpham/provenance#5`).** At the
journal-base layer (`#4`, S1.1) `tasks.LastJournalID` shipped **nullable**: the
pre-journal direct-write task-creation path predated the shared reducer, so tasks
had no watermark to populate until every task write flowed through `Apply`/`Open`
(§9). The tightening slice (`#5`) **retired that direct-write task path** — task
creation, update, and closure are journaled through the Session SDK (§16), the
graph `Store.AddVertex` no longer creates rows, and the bare direct-write insert is
gone — so a fresh native database now ships `tasks.LastJournalID` **`NOT NULL`** and
the only tasks-row `INSERT` is the reducer fold, which carries the watermark. A
legacy database that predates the tightening is upgraded to the anchored,
watermark-carrying shape by `MigrateLegacyBaseline` (§13), which re-tightens the column
back to `NOT NULL` once every row is anchored — so a migrated database enforces the
watermark invariant at the **schema level** exactly as a fresh one, not merely at the
migration instant; `VerifyIntegrity` (§15) additionally rejects any un-anchored
(NULL-watermark) task row over stored rows. The
lifecycle status baseline is the reducer zero (`open`) unless a **fixed-mapping
lifecycle event** moves it: `provenance.task.created` / `provenance.task.reopened` /
`provenance.task.stopped` → `open`, `provenance.task.started` → `in_progress`,
`provenance.task.closed` → `closed` (the fixed `StatusForEventKind` mapping, §5.1);
`in_progress` is reachable natively only through `provenance.task.started`, or through
a migration marker's captured legacy status (§13). Adding `provenance.task.started`
(and its `stopped` counterpart) is exactly the completion of §15's forward pointer
("route that status change through a journal lifecycle event once the direct-write path
retires").

**Static status FSM.** The four TRANSITION lifecycle kinds
(`started`/`stopped`/`closed`/`reopened`) move an EXISTING task between statuses under a
**static finite-state machine** — a fixed transition table over the closed status enum,
enforced in the shared reducer fold before the status projection is materialized. The
legal arrows are exactly:

| from | verb (kind) | to |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `Start` (`started`) | `in_progress` |
| `in_progress` | `Stop` (`stopped`) | `open` |
| `open` | `CloseTask` (`closed`) | `closed` |
| `in_progress` | `CloseTask` (`closed`) | `closed` |
| `closed` | `Reopen` (`reopened`) | `open` |

Every other `(from, kind)` pair is illegal, including a same-state repeat (e.g.
closing an already-closed task) and the direct `closed → in_progress` jump (a closed
task reaches `in_progress` only by `Reopen` then `Start`). An illegal transition fails
closed with the typed `InvalidStatusTransition{From, To, Kind}` (wrapping the
`ErrStatusTransition` sentinel, recoverable with `errors.Is`) and commits nothing. The
baseline-seeding kinds (`created`, `migrated`) are NOT transitions and are not checked:
`created` seeds `open` at birth, `migrated` seeds the captured legacy status (§13). The
FSM is enforced in the SINGLE shared reducer step Apply and Open both run (§9.2), so a
live `Apply` rejects an illegal transition before commit and Open's from-empty replay
applies the identical rule to the identical row — a committed transition is by
construction reproducible.

**Forced escape hatch.** A transition may be committed OUT of the FSM by a **forced**
coercion (the `Session` verbs invoked `WithForce`, the CLI `--force`): the reducer
records a forced marker in the produced journal row's payload and SKIPS the FSM for
exactly that one row. Because the marker lives in the journal row, the coercion is
**journal-reproducible** (Open's from-empty replay reads the marker and skips the FSM
identically) and **audit-visible** (the row's payload shows `forced:true`). Force
bypasses the FSM ONLY — never authorization (§9.3): a forced transition is still
authorized against the operation's authority at the effect's own `JournalID`.

### 8.2 `task_attributions`

| Attribute | Domain | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TaskID` | FK → `tasks.id` | no | part of PK |
| `ActorID` | FK → `agents.id` | no | part of PK |
| `FirstJournalID` | FK → `journal.JournalID` | no | earliest journal row establishing this actor's material contribution |

**FD:** `{TaskID, ActorID} → {FirstJournalID}`. **Candidate key / PK:** `{TaskID, ActorID}`. **BCNF:** trivial.

Append-only: a row is inserted the first time an actor materially
contributes to a task (an authority-assignment episode, a task event they
authored, evidence they attached) and is **never** deleted or overwritten
when `Task.Owner` later changes. `Task.Owner` (the current
`owner-responsibility` occupant, §8.1) and cumulative `task_attributions`
(every actor who ever materially contributed) are two independent
projections over the same journal history; they diverge by design once
ownership transfers.

**Attribution function (per `JournalKind`).** Which `ActorID` a produced row
attributes is fixed per kind, not left to the implementer — the two candidate
actors (a row's *effective* committing actor versus, for an assignment episode,
the occupant `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.ActorID`) can differ, so
the choice is stated explicitly. Because a subordinate row no longer stores its
committing actor (§2.1), the "committing actor" a rule names below is the
**derived effective actor** — `COALESCE(journal.ActorID, anchor.ActorID)` via
the §8.5 anchor self-join, equivalently the `effective_actor_id` column of the
`journal_attributed` view — never a hand-read of the (NULL) subordinate
`journal.ActorID` column:

| Produced row kind | Attributed `ActorID` |
|---|---|
| authority assignment episode (its `started` transition) | the episode's occupant, `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.ActorID` — **not** the derived committing actor |
| `journal_task_events` | the row's derived committing actor (the authoring actor, per the committing-actor model of §2.1) |
| `journal_evidence` | the row's derived committing actor (the actor who attached it) |
| `journal_decisions` with a non-NULL `TaskID` | the row's derived committing actor |
| `journal_decisions` with `TaskID` NULL | no edge (attribution is per task; an untasked decision attributes nothing) |

The committing actor of an operation does **not** earn an attribution edge
merely for committing: a Pasture-system actor executing a transfer or a
migration on behalf of an occupant attributes the *occupant* (via the episode's
`ActorID`), never itself. `owner_responsibility.yaml` /
`attribution-credits-occupant-not-committing-system-actor` pins this
occupant-not-committer case.

### 8.3 `task_event_activity` (view, not a base relation)

The filtered, task-scoped read that `pasture task event list` serves is
`SELECT * FROM journal JOIN journal_task_events USING (JournalID) WHERE
TaskID = :id ORDER BY JournalID`. It carries no independent key beyond the
`JournalID` it inherits and requires no FD/BCNF analysis of its own — it is a
query, not a stored relation. Downstream code must not treat this filtered
view as the complete history: the global journal API additionally exposes
unfiltered ordered access across every `JournalKind`.

### 8.4 `assignment_current` (view, not a base relation)

"Who currently holds slot `S` on task `T`" is `SELECT episode.* FROM
journal_authority_assignment_episodes episode JOIN
journal_authority_assignment_transitions started ON started.AssignmentID =
episode.AssignmentID AND started.Transition = 'started' WHERE episode.TaskID
= T AND episode.SlotID = S AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM
journal_authority_assignment_transitions ended WHERE ended.AssignmentID =
episode.AssignmentID AND ended.Transition = 'ended') ORDER BY
started.JournalID DESC LIMIT 1`. Also a view; also carries no independent key.

### 8.5 `journal_attributed` (view, not a base relation)

The base `journal` relation stores each committing actor exactly once, on the
anchor row (§2.1). Because a subordinate row's `ActorID` is NULL, every consumer
that wants "which actor is this row attributed to" would otherwise have to
hand-write the anchor self-join and its `COALESCE`. `journal_attributed` is the
single **read-only, denormalized** surface that does it once, so no consumer
re-derives it:

```
CREATE VIEW journal_attributed AS
SELECT j.JournalID                        AS JournalID,
       j.JournalKind                      AS JournalKind,
       COALESCE(j.ActorID, anchor.ActorID) AS EffectiveActorID,
       j.RecordedAt                       AS RecordedAt,
       j.ProducedByOperationJournalID     AS ProducedByOperationJournalID
FROM journal j
LEFT JOIN journal anchor
  ON anchor.JournalID = j.ProducedByOperationJournalID
```

`EffectiveActorID` is `j.ActorID` on an anchor row (its own stored actor) and
the anchor's `ActorID` on a subordinate row (the committing actor it derives).
It is the consumer-facing attribution surface: internal query and attribution
reads that need a row's actor (§8.2, §8.3, the ordered query surface of §8.3/§12)
go through this view or the equivalent inline join, never through a bare read of
the subordinate `journal.ActorID` column. Like §8.3/§8.4 it is a keyless,
derived, reproducible projection — it carries no independent key beyond the
`JournalID` it inherits, stores nothing, and is a pure function of `journal`, so
it needs no FD/BCNF analysis of its own. It is `LEFT JOIN`, not `JOIN`, so an
anchor row (whose `ProducedByOperationJournalID` is NULL) still appears, with
`EffectiveActorID = j.ActorID`.

## 9. Shared reducer contract

`Apply` (live mutation) and `Open` (startup replay) MUST call one reducer.
This is a specification constraint on every relation above, not an
implementation detail: the schema is shaped so that the reducer can be a
**pure** function of journal rows, with no other mutable input feeding it.

Let `Reduce(history, uptoJournalID) → ProjectionState` denote that function,
where `ProjectionState` is exactly the tuple of projections in §8
(`tasks.*` current-state columns, `task_attributions` rows, the
`assignment_current` view's underlying episode/transition rows) as of
`uptoJournalID`.

### 9.1 Determinism

`Reduce` depends only on the ordered sequence of `journal` rows (joined to
their typed subtype row) with `JournalID ≤ uptoJournalID`. No wall-clock
read, random value, or external service call may influence its output. Given
the same prefix, `Reduce` always returns the same `ProjectionState` — this is
what makes `LastJournalID` (§8.1) a meaningful convergence checkpoint. This
determinism presupposes that `journal` rows already have a total order
(`JournalID`); for the effects *within* one not-yet-committed operation, which
have no `JournalID` assigned yet, that order is fixed by §9.3.1 before folding
begins.

### 9.2 Incrementality equals bulk-replay equivalence

For any `J1 ≤ J2`: replaying the whole prefix `history[..J2]` from empty
state produces the same `ProjectionState` as seeding `Reduce` with
`Reduce(history, J1)` and folding only `history[J1+1..J2]`. This licenses
`Apply` — which only ever sees one new operation's rows appended to prior
state — and `Open` — which replays the entire history after a restart — to
share one reducer implementation: `Apply`'s "state visible at the start of a
transaction" is `Reduce(history, J_before)`; it writes new rows, then the
same fold step produces `Reduce(history, J_after)`. `Open` is simply this
same fold applied from `J=0` in one pass. There is no second switch
statement over event kinds, no second closure-validation pass, and no
duplicated case list — this is the direct fix for the salvage regression
where a superseded implementation's `Apply` reducer switched on 43 `mutation.Mutation`
command-type branches while a wholly separate `Open`-time
`taskLifecycleProjection.apply` switched on 9 `journal.EventKind` branches,
requiring a long sequence of follow-up patches (evidenced by that
implementation's own commit history) to keep the two in sync.

### 9.3 Per-effect authority checkpoint

Before the reducer accepts a proposed effect row (a `journal_task_events`,
`journal_authority_*`, `journal_decisions`, or `journal_evidence` row) as
part of committing one operation, it evaluates that specific effect's
authority precondition against `Reduce(history, J_current - 1)` — every row
committed strictly before this effect, **including earlier effects of the
same in-flight operation**. Concretely: when one operation folds a batch of
$N$ effects inside a single transaction, the reducer must fold them one at a
time, re-deriving working state after each, and validate effect $k{+}1$
against that updated state — never against the snapshot taken once at the
start of the whole transaction. This is the fix for the salvage regression
where a single authority check gated an entire `ConditionalMutationBatch` and
its children reused that one already-validated authority value rather than
being independently re-authorized against their own emerging state — the
concrete case is worked out in
[`authority_evidence.yaml`](../testdata/contract/authority_evidence.yaml).

### 9.3.1 Intra-operation effect order

§9.3 folds an operation's $N$ effects one at a time; the order in which they are
folded — which effect is $1$ and which is $k{+}1$ — is exactly the order the
caller's `Mutation`/command structure lists its child effects: an ordinal
array/slice position, fixed before folding begins. It is **never** re-derived
from Go map or set iteration order, from a sort over any non-ordinal field (a
`TaskID`, `SlotID`, digest, or `RecordedAt`), or from any other
non-deterministic source. This order fixes both each effect's relative
`JournalID` assignment and the state each subsequent effect's §9.3 authority
check is evaluated against, so it is a precondition of §9.1's determinism claim:
two independent constructions of the same logical operation must fold — and
therefore journal — their effects identically. An implementation that collected
an operation's effects into a Go map (e.g. keyed by `TaskID` or `SlotID`, a
natural shape given the keying elsewhere in this schema) before folding would
silently violate this rule under Go's randomized map iteration; this section is
the rule such an implementation violates.

### 9.4 Idempotent replay short-circuit

If `journal_operations` already holds a row for the proposed `OperationID`,
the reducer compares the proposed operation's exact replay identity —
`(ActorID` from `journal`, `AuthorityJournalID, CommandDigest,
MutationDigest)` — against the stored row. An exact match short-circuits:
the effect-folding step in §9.3 is **not** invoked at all, and the already-committed
effect closure (`§2.1`'s `ProducedByOperationJournalID` query) is returned
unchanged. Any mismatch on the four-field identity is a typed conflict, never
a re-execution and never a partial write.

**Precedence vs. genesis validity (§4.6, §10 rule 6).** This `OperationID`-presence
check is evaluated **before** any operation-kind-specific validity check,
including §4.6/§10 rule 6's genesis "no `journal_operations` row yet exists"
check. Concretely: a retry of the genesis operation itself (same
`OperationID`, arriving after the journal is no longer empty) hits this
short-circuit first and returns the original bootstrap authority; it never
reaches rule 6's genesis-validity check, so it is not rejected as a "second
genesis". Rule 6 only ever evaluates — and only ever rejects — a genesis
presenting a **new** `OperationID` against a non-empty journal.

### 9.5 Fail-closed atomicity

If effect-folding fails at effect $k$ of $N$ — whatever the cause, including
injected faults — none of effects $1..k-1$ remain committed. The whole
operation's journal rows, including its own anchor row in `journal_operations`,
roll back as a single SQL transaction. This is unchanged from the existing
`STRICT`/transactional discipline already used across the live schema; the
journal model does not relax it.

#### Exact assignment conditions

`AssignmentActiveCondition(AssignmentActiveAssertion)` adds the disjoint
`ConditionAssignmentActive` arm. The assertion contains `AssignmentID`, `TaskID`,
`SlotID`, `Occupant`, `AuthorityJournalID`, and `ParentAssignmentID`. The authority
must identify that exact episode's **start**, not its operation anchor, material
evidence, parent authority, or an alternate assignment on the same task. A nil
parent asserts SQL NULL; a nonnil parent asserts exactly that nonempty ID.
`Selector` and `AssertedJournalID` must be zero for this arm. Fact conditions must
leave `AssignmentActive` nil. The sole registered slot remains
`SlotOwnerResponsibility`; application roles are not assignment slots.

Ordinary direct and borrowed `Apply` evaluate this condition after exact replay
or conflict admission and before inserting effects, on the same write-owned
SQLite transaction. The episode and every cited ancestor must have a linked
assignment-start authority and no end transition. Ancestor starts must strictly
precede their children; missing or cyclic lineage fails closed. Failure returns
`ConditionFailure` with `ConditionAssignmentInactive`, the asserted start ID,
and actual ID zero, leaving the operation absent and no partial journal or
projection rows. This predicate does not consume/end an assignment, change the
operation's authority, or grant cross-actor delegation. Applications must retain
their actor/delegation checks independently.

Composed allocation uses the same condition dispatcher in its existing SQL
transaction. Its allocation rows have been staged at that point, but no
supplemental effects or success checkpoint have been written. A condition failure
rolls back those allocation rows too. Exact replay reconstructs receipts before
mutable conditions. The existing DBOS adapter may durably record a typed domain
**failure** outcome; it must not record a successful application checkpoint.

Changing or removing an assertion under a committed OperationID conflicts.
Exact retry returns the prior result even after later assignment revocation,
without checking mutable conditions again. This applies to old fact-only
operations too.

#### Canonical compatibility and physical cost

Fact-only operations retain **byte-identical** `provenance.mutation.v1` frames
and SHA-256 digests. Only operations containing `ConditionAssignmentActive`
select `MutationEncodingV2` (`provenance.mutation.v2`). Mixed fact/assignment
lists use V2, preserving fact frames and ordered condition semantics. A V2
envelope without an assignment arm and a V1 envelope with that arm are refused;
there is no global promotion of old operations. V2 retains existing effect
encoding. Its assignment arm has the kind frame followed by one
`assignment-active` frame containing canonical JSON with exactly these members:

```json
{"assignment_id":"action","authority_journal_id":42,"occupant":"fixture--018f0000-0000-7000-8000-000000000002","parent_assignment_id":"parent","slot_id":"owner-responsibility","task_id":"fixture--018f0000-0000-7000-8000-000000000001"}
```

All members are required. Only `parent_assignment_id` admits null (explicit no
parent). The canonical decoder rejects unknown/duplicate/missing/mixed/trailing
fields, wrong shapes, invalid IDs and alternate scalar representations, using
the existing strict JSON boundary and byte-identical re-encoding. These are
canonical wire rules, not a new permissive JSON-to-Apply entry point.

The independently authored `mutation_v2_assignment.bin` pins digest
`ded32ff7e1c7d269f5f2d6ed0334c22e356c1c5685b07de9383790c70695279b`.
The unchanged V1 `mutation_v1_v004.bin` pins digest
`e3ea1ba027e09604e3c78638c5bd54eef1a4cb07719bf871054b65d39ae129b8`.
New readers decode, verify integrity, reopen and replay both versions. V1-only
readers reject the V2 version frame; once V2 operations exist, downgrade to a
V1-only binary is unsupported. No schema migration is needed: existing operation
columns already store an opaque nonempty encoding tag and canonical bytes.

The predicate performs one indexed joined episode/start/end/authority/journal
probe per lineage level. It never scans same-task alternatives or counts the
whole episode table. With at most `MaxCanonicalConditions` (64) assertions, the
query count is the sum of their lineage depths, **not total O(1)**; each probe's
index cost still depends on SQLite index size. A depth-1/4/16 test measures
64/256/1024 queries respectively for 64 assertions, and checks the actual SQLite
query plan for five indexed searches with no scan. Other existing effect
governance walks have their own cost and are not included in this predicate
budget. No process mutex, new transaction, schema, or downstream private SQL is
part of this API.

### 9.6 Concurrency contention point

Two concurrent `Apply` calls contend at a single serialization point: SQLite's
single-writer transaction semantics, under which at most one write transaction
commits at a time and the second-executing transaction observes the first's
already-committed rows. The contract's two "exactly one concurrent writer wins"
outcomes resolve there:

- **Transfer CAS** (`owner_responsibility.yaml` /
  `transfer-cas-single-winner-loser-gets-stale-conflict`). Both transfer
  operations validate their precondition against `Reduce(history, J_current − 1)`.
  Because writes serialize, the loser's transaction runs after the winner's has
  committed; its §9.3 precondition re-check now observes the winner's committed
  `ended` transition on episode A, finds A no longer active, and the reducer
  rejects it with a typed `stale-episode-conflict`, writing nothing. The
  `UNIQUE(AssignmentID, Transition)` and `UNIQUE(PredecessorAssignmentID)`
  constraints are a defence-in-depth backstop (a raw violation would surface only
  if two writers somehow both reached the write step), but the **primary,
  specified** mechanism is the serialized precondition re-check yielding the
  typed conflict — not a raw database error.
- **Concurrent same-new-`OperationID`** (§9.4, §11). Two callers may each look up
  the proposed new `OperationID`, each see no existing `journal_operations` row,
  and each attempt to insert the anchor. Serialization means one insert commits
  first; the second transaction's insert then violates
  `journal_operations.OperationID UNIQUE`. The reducer catches that violation and
  re-runs the §9.4 idempotent-replay path against the now-committed row: an exact
  four-field identity match returns the original anchor (idempotent success);
  otherwise it surfaces the typed `CommittedConflict`.

In both cases the caller observes a **typed** conflict/idempotent result, never a
raw SQLite constraint error: the translation from any backstop constraint
violation to the typed result happens inside the reducer, at the `Apply`
boundary, before returning to the caller.

## 10. Totality rules

1. Every committed logical operation produces exactly one `journal_operations`
   row, including an operation with zero task-domain effects (a pure
   authority-lifecycle operation, or an explicit zero-length
   `AppendTaskEventBatch`). The anchor row's own `journal.ProducedByOperationJournalID`
   is `NULL`; every other row it produces has that column set to the
   anchor's `JournalID`.
2. Every non-anchor journal row (`JournalKind ∈ {task_event, authority,
   decision, evidence}`) has exactly one producing operation —
   `ProducedByOperationJournalID` is `NOT NULL` and refers to exactly one
   `journal_operations.JournalID`.

   **S1.1 staging note — RESOLVED (`dayvidpham/provenance#5`).** At the
   journal-base layer (`#4`, S1.1) no `journal_operations` subtype table exists
   yet, so `AppendTaskEvent` — the pre-operations base primitive — writes
   `task_event` rows with `ProducedByOperationJournalID = NULL` uniformly, and that
   NULL-producer shape is valid **at that layer** (its standalone tests stay green).
   The operations layer (`#5`) completes the `ProducedByOperationJournalID →
   journal_operations.JournalID` foreign key AND adds the **task-event producer
   `CHECK`** to the same journal rebuild: `CHECK (JournalKind <> 'task_event' OR
   ProducedByOperationJournalID IS NOT NULL)`. Every task event is now produced by
   an operation (a native create/update/lifecycle event, or a migration baseline
   marker), so the only thing the `CHECK` rejects is the retired bare NULL-producer
   append; the base primitive's method shape is unchanged (the layering holds
   because only *which callers remain legal* changes under `#5`'s schema), and the
   bare-append public path is retired from the operations-layer `Journal`.
   `VerifyIntegrity`'s §10 rule 8 subtype-integrity guard is orthogonal to rule 2.
3. Common fields (`JournalKind`, `ActorID`, `RecordedAt`) are never
   duplicated on a subtype row; a subtype row's only own attributes are the
   ones that do not already exist on the supertype.
4. `OperationID` is never a determinant of ordering and never a primary key
   anywhere in this schema (§3.1, §6).
5. **Anchor-only actor placement.** A journal row carries a stored `ActorID`
   **iff** it is an anchor row: `ActorID NOT NULL` exactly when
   `ProducedByOperationJournalID IS NULL` (an operation anchor, genesis, or
   migration baseline), and `ActorID NULL` on every subordinate (operation-produced)
   row, whose committing actor is instead *derived* from its anchor (§2.1, §8.5).
   The earlier committing-actor *agreement* rule — which forbade a produced row
   restamping a **different** actor than its anchor — is retired: a subordinate
   row has no `ActorID` column to disagree, so disagreement is structurally
   impossible rather than reducer-guarded. This placement invariant is expressed
   directly by a `CHECK ((ActorID IS NULL) = (ProducedByOperationJournalID IS NOT
   NULL))` constraint on `journal` **and** re-checked by the reducer /
   `VerifyIntegrity`: `Apply` rejects any input effect that would stamp an actor
   on a subordinate row, and `VerifyIntegrity` scans for any stored subordinate
   row carrying an `ActorID` (or any anchor row missing one) and rejects it. Its
   must-fail history is `authority_evidence.yaml` /
   `subordinate-row-carrying-actor-rejected`.
6. **Genesis NULL-authority discipline.** `journal_operations.AuthorityJournalID`
   is `NULL` only on a **genesis operation** (§4.6), and a genesis operation is
   accepted only when no `journal_operations` row yet exists — i.e. it is the
   first operation in the journal. Any later operation presenting a `NULL`
   `AuthorityJournalID`, or any genesis attempted against a non-empty journal, is
   rejected before commit. **Precedence:** this check is evaluated only after
   §9.4's `OperationID`-presence short-circuit — a same-`OperationID` retry of
   the genesis operation is resolved by §9.4 (returns the original bootstrap
   authority) before this rule ever runs, so this rule rejects only a genesis
   presenting a *new* `OperationID` against a non-empty journal, never an
   idempotent retry of the first one. See §4.6's precedence note.
7. **Genesis sole effect.** A genesis operation's only effect is exactly one
   `journal_authorities` row with `AuthorityKind = 'bootstrap'` (plus its
   `journal_authority_bootstraps` detail row): no task events, assignment
   transitions, decisions, or evidence. A `NULL`-authority operation producing any
   other or additional effect is rejected.
8. **Subtype totality, exclusivity, and discriminator agreement.** Enforced by
   the reducer at both inheritance levels (`journal` → its
   `journal_operations`/`journal_task_events`/`journal_authorities`/`journal_decisions`/`journal_evidence`
   subtypes, and `journal_authorities` → its `journal_authority_bootstraps`/assignment
   detail rows). Because doctrine 3 (rule 3 above) forbids repeating the
   discriminator on subtype rows, the schema cannot express these with a composite
   `(JournalID, JournalKind)` foreign key, so the reducer enforces, before commit:
   *(totality)* every `journal` row has exactly one subtype row selected by its
   `JournalKind`; *(exclusivity)* no `JournalID` appears in two subtype tables;
   *(agreement)* a subtype row's table matches its `journal.JournalKind`, and an
   authority's bootstrap/assignment detail matches its `AuthorityKind`.
   `subtype_integrity.yaml` carries the must-fail histories (no subtype, two
   subtypes, discriminator mismatch, and the authority-level
   bootstrap-with-transition mismatch).
9. **Result-slot own-operation integrity.** A `journal_operation_result_slots`
   row's `ProducedJournalID` must identify a `journal` row whose own
   `ProducedByOperationJournalID` equals the slot row's own `JournalID` — a
   result slot may only map to a row produced by its own operation (§3.2). The
   two FKs alone permit a slot row pointing at another operation's produced
   row; the reducer rejects this before commit.

## 11. OperationID doctrine

`OperationID` is a caller-supplied, globally unique, typed alternate key
(`journal_operations.OperationID UNIQUE NOT NULL`) whose sole purpose is
idempotency correlation across retries. It is:

- **not** the primary key of `journal_operations` (`JournalID` is, §3.1);
- **not** a source of ordering anywhere — ordering is exclusively `JournalID`;
- compared, not enumerated: the reducer's replay check (§9.4) looks up the
  single row for a given `OperationID` and compares four fields; it never
  scans or orders by `OperationID`.

Reusing an `OperationID` with a different `(ActorID, AuthorityJournalID,
CommandDigest, MutationDigest)` tuple is a typed conflict and commits
nothing.

## 12. RecordedAt doctrine

`RecordedAt` is copied from caller-supplied wall-clock time (or, during
legacy migration, from the historical row being migrated — §13) into
`journal.RecordedAt`. Its whole point is to provide **a readable timeline over
what happened** — see §12.1. It is **non-causal**: it is never used to

- decide whether one journal row's effect happened "before" another for
  authority purposes (§9.3 uses `JournalID`, always);
- decide replay/migration order (§13 uses a documented deterministic
  pre-migration sort, not the migrated timestamps, precisely because two
  legacy rows can carry identical or misordered timestamps);
- order the **canonical** view of history — replay, authorization, lifecycle,
  and convergence order by `JournalID` and nothing else.

`RecordedAt` **is** used to order **display-facing listings** — the readable
timeline of §12.1 — but only there, and only as a non-causal presentation order.

Two journal rows sharing an identical `RecordedAt` is expected, not an error;
`JournalID` still totally orders them, and the timeline order breaks the tie by
`JournalID`. See [`ordering.yaml`](../testdata/contract/ordering.yaml) for the
adversarial cases pinning this.

### 12.1 Readable timeline

The whole point of `RecordedAt` is to provide a readable timeline over what
happened, so the journal query surface exposes a **display order** over it.
The `OrderByRecordedAt` dimension orders results by `(RecordedAt, JournalID)`:
wall-clock time, with `JournalID` as the composite tiebreak so equal timestamps
and backdated rows still yield a total, stable order.

**Display-vs-canonical firewall.** There are two order dimensions, and they are
kept strictly apart:

- **`OrderByRecordedAt` — non-causal display order.** A readable timeline over
  what happened. It NEVER establishes causality: no authorization, replay,
  lifecycle, or convergence decision consults it. It is the **default for
  display-facing listing queries** — an unqualified display query gets the
  readable timeline — because that is what a human reading history wants first.
- **`OrderByJournalID` — the canonical order.** The sole order for replay,
  authorization, lifecycle, and convergence. It remains available explicitly on
  the query surface, and it is the *only* order those causal paths ever use. The
  timeline dimension changes nothing about them.

**Composite cursor.** A timeline walk paginates with a composite **exclusive**
cursor `(after_recorded_at, after_journal_id)`: the next page returns rows whose
`(recorded_at, journal_id)` is strictly greater than the last row of the previous
page. Because the tiebreak is the total `JournalID` order, the walk never skips
or duplicates a row across equal timestamps or a backdated (timestamp-regressing)
row. The snapshot watermark is unchanged — still `JournalID`-bounded
(`journal_id <= snapshot`) — so a walk sees a consistent prefix of history under
either order.

**Covering index.** `CREATE INDEX idx_journal_recorded_at ON journal
(recorded_at, journal_id)` pairs with the dimension so the timeline walk seeks and
range-scans on `(recorded_at, journal_id)` without a filesort. The canonical order
continues to use the `journal_id` primary key.

The must-pass history
[`ordering.yaml`](../testdata/contract/ordering.yaml)/`timeline-walk-orders-by-recordedat-with-journalid-tiebreak`
proves a paginated timeline walk across an equal-timestamp tie and a backdated row
returns every row exactly once in `(recorded_at, journal_id)` order, while the
canonical `JournalID` query still returns commit order.

## 13. Legacy-baseline semantics

Migrating a pre-journal database installs one `journal_operations` anchor per
existing task, in a deterministic pre-migration order (legacy `created_at`
ascending, then legacy `id` ascending — a documented, reproducible sort over
the *pre-migration* table, independent of any journal content, since none
exists yet). Because `legacy id` is `tasks.id`, the existing table's own
primary key, it is globally unique, so `(created_at, id)` is already a total,
unique order regardless of how many legacy rows share an identical `created_at`
— `id` alone breaks every tie.

**Legacy-schema upgrade (`#5`).** A legacy database exists **on disk with the old
schema** — it is never built through the new API. Its `tasks` table predates the
`#5` `LastJournalID` tightening: the watermark column is nullable, or (for a database
older than the journal-base layer) absent entirely, and its rows carry no watermark.
Migration upgrades such a database **in place**: it first ensures the `LastJournalID`
column exists (the column-add path — a no-op when the column is already present, an
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN LastJournalID INTEGER REFERENCES journal(JournalID)` when
it is absent), then journal-anchors every legacy row (the baseline events below),
whose reducer projection populates each row's watermark, and finally **re-tightens the
column back to `NOT NULL`** once no un-anchored task row remains. When a run anchors the
whole table — the ordinary full-database migration — every task row then carries a
watermark, so the `NOT NULL` constraint is restored at the **schema level** exactly as on
a fresh native database: a migrated database is not merely data-level-satisfied at the
migration instant but structurally protected from a later un-journaled `NULL`-watermark
write, closing what would otherwise be a fresh-vs-migrated asymmetry. If the caller
migrated only a subset and un-anchored legacy rows remain, the table cannot yet satisfy
`NOT NULL`, so the column stays at the legacy nullable shape and a later migration of the
rest completes the tightening (the gate keeps the step fail-closed rather than erroring on
a still-`NULL` row). `VerifyIntegrity` (§15) additionally rejects any un-anchored row over
stored data throughout. The re-tightening runs as its own foreign-key-safe atomic rebuild
immediately after the anchor batch commits (the canonical SQLite table rebuild toggles
`PRAGMA foreign_keys`, a no-op inside a transaction, so it cannot nest inside the anchor
savepoint), under the single migration lock; if it fails, the committed anchors are left
in the valid legacy nullable shape and an idempotent re-run re-applies the re-tightening.
The proof corpus models a legacy
database via a **test-only old-schema seeding seam** — `SeedLegacyTask` downgrades a
native schema to the legacy nullable (or column-less) watermark shape and raw-inserts
a pre-journal row, mirroring an on-disk legacy database, never routing through the
public API — so the migration path is exercised against exactly the input it upgrades
in production, and §13.2's migrated/native equivalence compares fully-anchored
post-migration state on both sides.

The whole migration executes under the `pasture-system` bootstrap authority
established by the genesis operation (§4.6): the genesis operation is the first
row written, then per-task anchors follow, each an ordinary non-genesis
operation citing that bootstrap authority. Each per-task baseline **anchor**
row stores `journal.ActorID` = the Pasture system actor (the actor *executing*
the migration, per the committing-actor model of §2.1); every subordinate
baseline row it produces (the migration-marker event, the assignment
transitions) carries `ActorID` NULL and *derives* that same system actor from
its anchor (§8.5) — the anchor-only placement of §2.1/§10 rule 5 applies to
migration baselines exactly as to native operations. The system actor is
**never** the legacy owner — the legacy owner appears only as the occupant
`ActorID` on the assignment episode (item 2). Each per-task baseline anchor's `OperationID` is a
deterministic function of the legacy task id — `provenance.migration.baseline--<legacy
tasks.id>` — so a re-run after a partially-recovered migration (or an accidental
second invocation) presents the identical `OperationID` per task and hits §9.4's
idempotent short-circuit (or a typed conflict), never a duplicate baseline
anchor. The anchor row's own `journal.RecordedAt` is the legacy task's
`updated_at` — the same honest legacy value used for its migration-marker event
(item 1), never the migration's wall-clock time. For each legacy task, in that
order:

1. One `journal_task_events` row, `EventKind = 'provenance.task.migrated'`,
   `RecordedAt` set to the legacy row's own `updated_at` — **never** the
   migration's own wall-clock time. There is no second timestamp column
   anywhere in this schema for a baseline row to accidentally use instead
   (unlike a superseded implementation, which additionally stored a
   `committed_operations.committed_at` populated with `time.Now()` beside the
   event's honestly-migrated `recorded_at` — that second column does not
   exist here, so there is no place left for a wall-clock value to leak into
   a supposedly historical record).
2. If the legacy task has a non-`NULL` owner: one
   `journal_authority_assignment_episodes` row (`SlotID =
   'owner-responsibility'`, `ActorID` = the legacy owner, `PredecessorAssignmentID
   = NULL`) and one `started` `journal_authority_assignment_transitions` row,
   `RecordedAt` = the same legacy `updated_at`.
3. If the legacy task's status is `Closed`: an additional `ended` transition
   row on that same episode, `RecordedAt` = the legacy `closed_at` if present,
   else the legacy `updated_at` — again never wall-clock `now`.
4. If the legacy owner does not resolve to a registered `ActorID` (an
   unmappable owner string, e.g. orphaned free-text left over from a
   pre-Provenance import): the **entire migration transaction** fails closed
   with a typed `MigrationOwnerUnmappableError` (§13.1); no task is migrated
   with a synthesized or guessed `ActorID`, and no partial baseline is left
   committed for any other task in the same run.

Because the resulting baseline rows are ordinary `journal`/`journal_operations`/
`journal_authority_*` rows — not a special pre-journal state format — a
subsequent real transfer chains off a migrated episode exactly as it would
off any other episode (`PredecessorAssignmentID` pointing at the migrated
`AssignmentID`). There is no separate "final row" shortcut anywhere in this
schema for legacy state: `Reduce` (§9) replays baseline rows through the
identical fold used for every other row.

**External-schema preflight.** Before the migration transaction opens, the
migration routine verifies the pre-journal schema's exact expected shape —
table **and** column presence/absence, in **both** directions: a missing
expected table, a missing expected column, an unexpected extra table, or an
unexpected extra column. Any mismatch — or any other topology corruption —
fails closed with a typed `SchemaPreflightError` (§13.1) before any row is
written. See
[`topology_corruption.yaml`](../testdata/contract/topology_corruption.yaml).

### 13.1 Fail-closed error shape

Both fail-closed paths in this section return a **typed, named-field error** —
not a prose-only "actionable error" — mirroring `dayvidpham/provenance#6`'s
established `StoreUnavailableError{Operation, Store, Stage, Impact, Fix, Cause}`
/ `CheckpointDivergenceError{Operation, Stage, Impact, Fix, Cause}` convention.
Each carries every component of the repo's six-part actionable-error contract:
**what** failed, **why**, **where**, **when**, caller **impact**, and **how to
fix**.

- **`MigrationOwnerUnmappableError`** (item 4):
  `{ Operation, Task, RawOwner, Stage, Why, Impact, Fix, Cause }`.
  - *what*: `Task` + `RawOwner` — the offending legacy task id and the raw
    unmappable owner string;
  - *why*: `Why` — the owner string resolved to no registered `ActorID`;
  - *where*: `Operation` + `Stage` — the migration routine and the
    owner-resolution stage;
  - *when*: `Stage` — owner resolution, before any baseline row for the run is
    committed;
  - *impact*: `Impact` — the entire migration transaction rolled back, zero
    baselines for any task;
  - *fix*: `Fix` — register the owner as an actor, or correct/remove the legacy
    owner string, then re-run (the deterministic `OperationID` scheme makes the
    re-run idempotent).
- **`SchemaPreflightError`** (external-schema preflight):
  `{ Operation, ExpectedShape, FoundShape, Stage, Why, Impact, Fix, Cause }`.
  - *what*: `ExpectedShape` vs `FoundShape` — the exact table/column the
    preflight expected and what it actually found (missing table, missing
    expected column, or unexpected extra column);
  - *why*: `Why` — the live schema does not match the shape this build
    understands;
  - *where*: `Operation` + `Stage` — the preflight routine and the specific
    table/column check;
  - *when*: `Stage` — preflight, strictly before any transaction opens;
  - *impact*: `Impact` — no row of any kind is written, activation halts;
  - *fix*: `Fix` — restore the expected schema shape or run the correct forward
    migration, then re-open.

Every field is non-empty on return. An implementation that fails closed with a
bare `errors.New("unmappable owner")` — carrying only a *what* — does **not**
satisfy this contract even though it technically "fails closed"; the corpus
must-fail cases in `baseline_migration.yaml` and `topology_corruption.yaml`
assert each of the six actionable components is present and non-empty
(`errorHasWhat`/`errorHasWhy`/`errorHasWhere`/`errorHasWhen`/`errorHasImpact`/`errorHasFix`),
so an inadequately actionable fail-closed error cannot pass this corpus.

### 13.2 Migrated/native observational equivalence

For any legacy task `T`, the `ProjectionState` (§9) produced by `Reduce` over
`[T`'s migrated baseline rows, followed by a sequence of native operations
`O_1..O_n]` is **identical** to the `ProjectionState` produced by `Reduce` over
a native-only history that creates an equivalent task and applies the same
logical sequence of operations reaching the same state. Migrated and native
history prefixes are observationally indistinguishable to the reducer beyond
`RecordedAt` provenance: because §13's baseline rows are ordinary
`journal`/`journal_operations`/`journal_authority_*` rows folded through the
identical §9 reducer — not a special pre-journal state format — nothing
downstream of a migrated episode (a transfer chaining off its `AssignmentID`, a
close ending its occupancy, an attribution edge) can observe that the episode
originated in migration rather than in a native `StartTaskAssignment`. This is
the concrete statement of the acceptance criterion "migrated/native histories
are observationally equivalent", pinned by `baseline_migration.yaml` /
`migrated-then-native-extended-equals-native-only`.

## 14. Authority consumption rules

### 14.1 Per-effect authorization at the effect's own JournalID

Specified in §9.3: every consuming effect is authorized against
`Reduce(history, J_current - 1)`, the state visible strictly before that
effect's own journal position — including effects from earlier in the same
operation — never against a single pre-transaction snapshot reused for every
child of a batch.

**What "authorized" means (the governance predicate).** An operation cites one
authority; that authority must *govern* the task each of its consuming effects
mutates, evaluated at the effect's own journal position. Governance is decided
by authority kind:

- a **bootstrap** authority (the pasture-system root, §4.6) governs every task;
- an **assignment** authority governs (a) the task of its own episode, and (b)
  every task reachable from that episode by deliberate parent citations, with
  whole-chain liveness — the full transitive rule is specified in §14.5.

Governance is **deliberate citation**, never graph-topology inference. A task
that is merely *reachable* from the authority's task through a `blocked_by`
scheduling edge (or any other non-citation edge) is **not** governed: a
scheduling edge orders work, it does not delegate ownership. The
`blocked-by-scheduling-edge-does-not-grant-authority` corpus case pins this —
an authority on a prereq task cannot mutate an unrelated dependent that merely
lists the prereq as a blocker. The only cross-task reach an assignment
authority has is the parent-citation chain of §14.5.

### 14.2 Single-consumption ownership-assignment evidence

`journal_authority_assignment_episodes.PredecessorAssignmentID` carries a
`UNIQUE` constraint. A given episode can be cited as the predecessor of **at
most one** successor episode — two different new assignments cannot both
claim to succeed the same old one. This is the schema-level enforcement of
"multiply consumed evidence is rejected."

### 14.3 Orphaned evidence rejection

Referential integrity alone (the `PredecessorAssignmentID` foreign key)
guarantees the cited `AssignmentID` *exists*; it cannot express "and it has
an `ended` transition." That additional property is a reducer-level
business-rule check, layered on top of the FK: a `started` transition whose
episode names a `PredecessorAssignmentID` that has no `ended` transition row
(i.e. the predecessor is still active, or was never properly started) is
rejected before commit. This is documented here as a business rule the
schema cannot fully express structurally, precisely so the proof corpus
carries a dedicated negative case for it rather than relying on the FK alone
to appear sufficient.

### 14.4 Assignment-transition lifecycle order

`UNIQUE(AssignmentID, Transition)` (§4.4) bounds an episode to at most one
`started` and at most one `ended` row but cannot express their required order.
The reducer enforces, before commit, for every `AssignmentID`: a `started`
transition appears first (exactly once); an `ended` transition is optional (at
most once) and, when present, must carry a strictly greater `JournalID` than
that episode's `started` transition. An `ended` transition with no prior
`started`, or a `started`/`ended` pair written in inverted `JournalID` order
(including both written in one batch with `ended` folded before `started`,
which §9.3's sequential per-effect fold also surfaces), is rejected. This is the
base lifecycle-order rule the neighboring orphan rule (§14.3) implicitly
assumes — §14.3 speaks of a predecessor that "has no ended transition row (…or
was never properly started)", which presupposes exactly this ordering. Stated
here (per the §14.3 convention) because the schema cannot express it;
`authority_evidence.yaml` carries `ended-transition-without-started-rejected`
and `ended-before-started-in-one-batch-rejected`.

### 14.5 Parent-citation governance (deliberate ownership reach)

§9.3/§14.1 fix *when* an authority is checked (against `Reduce(history, J_current
− 1)`); this section fixes *what task* an authority governs — the scope the
per-effect checkpoint evaluates:

- A **bootstrap** authority (the genesis/system root, §4.6) governs **every**
  task.
- An **assignment** authority governs (a) the task of its own active episode
  (a `started`-but-not-`ended` episode, §14.4), and (b) every task reachable
  from that episode by **deliberate parent citations**, with whole-chain
  liveness (specified below). It grants no other cross-task authority.

There is deliberately **no edge-graph governance**. A scheduling edge — in
particular `blocked_by`, which elsewhere in this system means only "the target
must be work that finishes before the source" (a dependency-ordering constraint,
enforced acyclic) — carries **no** ownership, hierarchy, or governance meaning. A
task merely reachable from an authority's episode-task through such an edge is
**not** governed by that authority: treating `blocked_by` reachability as
governance would let any active assignment on a shared prerequisite task (an
infra fix, a shared-library bump, a review gate) silently acquire write authority
over every organizationally unrelated task that lists it as a scheduling blocker
— an unbounded authorization over-grant. `authority_evidence.yaml` /
`blocked-by-scheduling-edge-does-not-grant-authority` pins this rejection. The
*only* cross-task reach an assignment authority has is the parent-citation chain
defined here — a chain of deliberate ownership citations, categorically
different from a scheduling edge.

**Re-pin under the §6.4 amendment.** Journaling an edge's *creation* (§6.4) does not
change this: a `blocked_by` edge now has a journaled birth (who added it, under which
authority, at which position), but the edge itself still delegates **no** ownership
authority. Governance flows only through parent citations, never through a journaled — or
any — scheduling edge. `mutation_families.yaml` /
`journaled-blocked-by-edge-grants-no-authority` pins that the ruling survives the
amendment; `blocked-by-scheduling-edge-does-not-grant-authority` remains authoritative.

An assignment authority reaches beyond its own task **only** through explicit
parent citations. This is the delegated-ownership relation: a supervisor holding
an episode on an epic can authorize work on a subtask precisely because the
chain of episodes between them was deliberately declared, transition by
transition — never because the tasks happen to be connected in some edge graph.

**The relation.** An episode may cite one **parent episode** at start, recorded
as `journal_authority_assignment_episodes.ParentAssignmentID` (§4.4), an
optional nullable self-reference. The citation is a *deliberate act performed at
the child episode's `started` transition*: it is invariant for the whole episode
(like every other episode attribute) and is chosen by the caller starting the
episode, who is asserting "this responsibility is delegated down from that
parent." It is categorically different from `PredecessorAssignmentID`
(§4.4): the predecessor edge records *succession in time* on one slot (a
transfer replaces an ended episode); the parent edge records *governance
lineage* across tasks (an active parent delegates to an active child). One is
about who held this slot before; the other is about who this responsibility
answers to.

**Citation validity (checked in the start effect, §9.3).** When an episode's
`started` transition cites `ParentAssignmentID = P`, the reducer requires, at
that transition's own journal position `J`:

1. `P` exists as an episode, and
2. `P` is **active at `J`** — it has a `started` transition strictly before `J`
   and no `ended` transition strictly before `J`. A citation of a
   never-started, already-ended, or nonexistent parent is rejected before
   commit (`ErrParentCitation`). You cannot deliberately root your work under an
   authority that is not live at the moment you claim it.
3. The citation does not create a **cycle**. Parent chains are finite and a new
   episode cannot appear in its own ancestry — with citation-at-start the child
   `AssignmentID` does not yet exist, so a genuine cycle is structurally
   impossible unless an identifier is forged or a stored chain is corrupted.
   The reducer still walks the cited parent's ancestry with a bounded, visited-
   tracked traversal and fails closed on any cycle rather than trusting the
   input's finiteness.

**The governance predicate.** An assignment authority whose episode is `E`
governs a target task `T`, evaluated at a consuming effect's journal position
`J`, when:

- **(a)** `E`'s own task is `T` and `E` is active at `J`; **or**
- **(b)** some episode on `T` reaches `E` by following `ParentAssignmentID`
  citations, and **every** episode on that chain — the child episode on `T`,
  each cited ancestor, up to and including `E` — is active at `J`.

Read the whole-chain liveness rule literally: the *entire* delegation chain must
be live at the effect's own position. If any middle episode has ended by `J`,
the delegated authority is cut immediately — a grandparent no longer governs a
grandchild once the parent between them ends, even though the grandchild episode
is still active and the parent citation still physically points at the ended
parent. Liveness is `active at effect time` for the whole chain, not merely at
citation time. The must-fail `parent-chain-middle-episode-ended-cuts-authority`
corpus case pins this.

**Implementation.** The predicate is a **recursive walk** over
`ParentAssignmentID`. The walk is bounded and visited-tracked; a corrupted stored
chain that forms a cycle (reachable only by bypassing citation validity, e.g. a
direct schema corruption) fails closed with a typed error
(`ErrCorruptParentChain`) rather than looping. The must-fail
`corrupted-cyclic-parent-chain-fails-closed` corpus case drives this via an
adversarial seam.

**Amendment status.** This section **is** the §14 amendment the earlier build
deferred behind a gate: the cross-task governing-parent reach — an
assignment-to-assignment parent-citation model — is now designed and delivered
here, so an assignment authority is no longer restricted to its own episode's
task. The one reach it still does not have is topological: a task merely
reachable through a scheduling edge is governed by nothing but its own citation
lineage.

## 15. Projection invariants

Restated from §8 for completeness: every projection (`tasks.*` current-state
columns, `task_attributions`, `task_event_activity`,
`assignment_current`) is reproducible **solely** from ordered `journal`
history — no projection may be seeded, patched, or reconciled from any
non-journal input. `tasks.LastJournalID` exists specifically so this claim is
checkable.

**`Open` verifies convergence by a genuine from-empty re-derivation.**
`ReplayProjections` (the `Open`/startup replay) does **not** re-fold on top of
the stored projection and diff a before/after snapshot — such an on-top re-fold
only detects drift in a field some journal row actually writes, so an
out-of-band corruption on a field no row revisits (e.g. a hand-corrupted
`tasks.status_id` on a task whose journal history carries **no** status-changing
lifecycle event) reads back unchanged and is silently reported as converged.
Instead, `Open` clears the projection to an empty slate in a scratch savepoint,
re-folds the entire journal through the one shared reducer step (§9.2), and
asserts `stored_projection == Reduce(history[..], from empty)` across the **full
projection set** — owner, status, watermark, **and** `task_attributions` — for
every task. The scratch rebuild is always rolled back, so the check is read-only
and idempotent; a genuine divergence fails closed with a typed
`ProjectionDivergenceError` (§13.1 six-field shape) naming the task, the
diverging field, and the stored-vs-derived values, and no projection is silently
repaired.

Because the re-derivation runs from empty, every value it seeds is itself a
journal fact: a task's status baseline is the reducer's zero (`open`) unless a
lifecycle event (created/reopened/closed) or a **migration marker** moves it — a
migration marker captures the migrated task's preserved legacy status in its own
payload (§13 item 1), and the reducer seeds status from **that captured journal
value**, never from the mutable `tasks` row, so a migrated-but-never-relifecycled
task's status remains reproducible solely from journal history.

**Staging scope — RESOLVED (`dayvidpham/provenance#5`).** Convergence is asserted
for **journal-anchored** tasks — those with at least one journal-spine row (a
`journal_task_events`, `journal_authority_*` episode, `journal_decisions`, or
`journal_evidence` row) — so their owner, status, watermark, and attributions are
all journal-reproducible. The direct-write task path is **retired**: task creation,
update, and closure flow through the Session SDK (§16) and are journaled, so a
"pure direct-write task with zero journal rows" is no longer produced — a native
task is born through the fold with a `provenance.task.created` event, and
`VerifyIntegrity` (§15/§8.1) rejects any un-anchored task row. The status-divergence
forward pointer is discharged: a native `in_progress` transition now routes through
the fixed-mapping `provenance.task.started` lifecycle event (§5.1, §8.1), so the
status is journal-reproducible and convergence holds — `Session.Update(Status:
in_progress)` emits `started`, never a direct column write. A migrated task **is**
journal-anchored and fully checked; a migration marker's captured legacy status
(§13) is the one non-native route to a baseline status.

## 16. Mutation SDK (`Session`)

`Session` is the mutation surface the Pasture task backend consumes. `Tracker.As(actor,
authority)` binds a committing actor and a governing authority once, and exposes the
task-tracker mutation verbs on one receiver. It sits on top of the low-level
`MutationContext`/`Apply` primitive (still public); reads stay on the `Tracker`
interface unchanged. Every verb is journaled: each builds one logical operation (§9) and
commits it through `Apply`, so every birth, metadata change, status transition, closure,
edge, label, and comment flows through the ordered journal and is reproducible from
history (§8.1, §15).

**Task lifecycle (`Create`, `Update`, and the dedicated status verbs).** `Create` mints
a `TaskID` and commits one task-create effect (the task is born through the fold with a
non-NULL watermark, §8.1). `Update` is **metadata-only**: the fields
`Title`/`Description`/`Priority`/`Phase`/`Notes` emit one `provenance.task.updated` event
materializing those columns; it never changes status, and an `Update` with no field set
is a journal-honest no-op. `Owner` is not settable through `Update` — ownership moves
only through assignment episodes (§4.4). The status lifecycle is governed by **four
dedicated verbs** under the static FSM (§8.1): `Start` (`open → in_progress`), `Stop`
(`in_progress → open`), `CloseTask` (`{open,in_progress} → closed`, also materializing
the close reason), and `Reopen` (`closed → open`). Each journals its own fixed-mapping
lifecycle kind; the shared reducer rejects an illegal transition (a same-state repeat, or
the direct `closed → in_progress`) with the typed `InvalidStatusTransition{From, To, Kind}`
(wrapping the `ErrStatusTransition` sentinel).
Any status verb may be invoked `WithForce` — the escape hatch (CLI `--force`) — to coerce
the FSM: the coercion is journaled with a forced marker, skips the FSM ONLY (never
authorization, §9.3), and is reproducible from history. A journaled verb against a
never-initialized (empty) journal returns an actionable `ErrGenesisRequired` (§4.6, §13)
rather than a deep authority-not-found. `Atomic(build)` commits a caller-composed
multi-effect operation in builder order with per-effect authorization (§9.3).

`Update` is deliberately narrowed to metadata: a status decomposition inside `Update`
would let a status change ride a metadata call and blur the FSM's boundary. The dedicated
verbs are the sole status surface, `Update(Status: …)` under the hood is exactly one such
verb's single-effect operation, and the forced escape hatch is available on every one of
them (per the recorded UAT Gate-2 ruling: dedicated verbs are the design; a forced
`--force` argument admits deliberate out-of-FSM coercion). Because there are no journal
consumers before launch, dropping the pre-`#5` `UpdateFields.Status` field is an accepted
compatibility break, not a preserved shim.

**Journaled relationship/annotation verbs (`AddEdge`, `RemoveEdge`, `AddLabel`,
`RemoveLabel`, `AddComment`) — §6.4.** Per the UAT Gate-1 ruling these five are now
**journaled** (the earlier un-journaled disclosure is void): each commits one typed
mutation-family effect (`provenance.edge.added`/`removed`, `provenance.label.added`/
`removed`, `provenance.comment.added`) under this Session's actor and authority, so who
added/removed the relationship, under which authority, at which journal position is
derivable from the journal (who-provenance, §6.4). The `edges`/`labels`/`comments` domain
tables are shared-reducer projections re-derivable from history (§6.4, §15), and
authorization is the same per-effect discipline as a task event (§9.3). The verb
**signatures are unchanged** — the forward-compatibility the earlier draft preserved made
this a non-breaking internal upgrade. A `blocked_by` edge-add is cycle-checked in the
reducer fold. The edge's *creation* being journaled does NOT make the edge grant
authority — §14.5 (a scheduling edge delegates no ownership) is unchanged. All eight
Session mutation verbs are thus journaled.

**OperationID and retry safety.** Every journaled verb defaults to a fresh UUIDv7
`OperationID`, so a naive retry after an ambiguous failure commits a **second**
operation. To make a journaled mutation idempotent, pin a stable `OperationID`
(`WithOperationID`) and reuse it verbatim on the retry: an exact same-identity replay
short-circuits to the original committed result (§9.4); a reused id presenting different
arguments is a typed conflict (§11). (`Create` mints a fresh `TaskID` on every call, so
even a pinned-id `Create` retry is idempotent only through the §9.4 short-circuit, which
returns the original task.)

## Adversarial proof corpus

Concrete adversarial histories live under `testdata/contract/` as
`Corpus[I,E]` YAML, following the same shape as the salvage `#7` corpus
harness (`must-pass`/`must-fail` classification, non-empty `provenance:
{source, ref}`, one named `mutation: {description, operator}` per case) so
`dayvidpham/provenance#7`'s harness can load these files directly once
implemented. Every case's `provenance.ref` names a GitHub issue
(`provenance#4`/`#5`/`#6`) or a specific salvage regression by the test name
that first exposed it — never a Beads ID or a proposal/slice/phase label.
